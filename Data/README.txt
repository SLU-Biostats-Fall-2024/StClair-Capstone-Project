I will only be using weeds_clean.csv for the data analysis, as tax.discoweed_18Dec2017_zenodo is the unclean version of it. tax.discoweed_updated is the cleaned version of tax.discoweed_18Dec2017_zenodo and weeds_clean.csv is the data set that only includes that variables that I will be preforming analysis on which are red_UK, lifeform, module, biogeo, and, biovigilance.
