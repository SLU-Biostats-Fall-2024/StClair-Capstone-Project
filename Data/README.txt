I will only be using tax.discoweed_updated for the data analysis, as tax.discoweed_18Dec2017_zenodo is the unclean version of it.

Explanation of all files:

nde-zenodo_1112341.json is the metadata provided in the database I found my dataset in.
StClair_hypothesis is the Word document that includes the different hypotheses I will be testing.
StClair_metadata is an explanation of the dataset, where it came from, why it was created, and what all the variables are.
tax.discoweed_updated is the clean and properly structured dataset I will use for my analysis.
tax.discoweed_18Dec2017_zenodo is the original dataset I downloaded before I fixed anything.
