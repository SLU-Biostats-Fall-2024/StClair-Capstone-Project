red_UK: Conservation status in the UK based on the Red List of vascular plants.
	NT: Near Threatened - Taxa close to qualifying as Vulnerable but not currently at high risk of extinction.
	VU: Vulnerable - Taxa facing a high risk of extinction in the medium-term future due to factors like population decline or restricted range.
	Wait: Awaiting assessment or review for conservation status; indicates temporary uncertainty.

module: Habitat categories based on Divgrass database:
	1: Dry calcareous grasslands.
	3: Mesic grasslands.
	5: Ruderal and trampled grasslands.

	Liana: Climbing or trailing plants.

biogeo: Biogeographical classification
	Atlantic: Found in regions with Atlantic climatic influence.
	Circumboreal: Distributed around boreal regions globally.
	Cosmopolitan: Found nearly worldwide.
	Eurasian: Native to or spanning Europe and Asia.
	European: Restricted to Europe.
	Holarctic: Found in northern hemisphere's temperate and Arctic zones.
	Introduced: Non-native species (e.g., Introduced (North America) indicates origin in North America).
	Mediterranean: Native to or primarily found in the Mediterranean region.
	Orophyte: Found in mountainous areas.
	Subtropical: Found in subtropical climates.
	Endemics: Localized species such as Aquitanian, Corsican, Provencal.
	Arctic-Alpine: Restricted to Arctic and Alpine regions.

biovigilance: Presence in France's national survey of cultivated fields
